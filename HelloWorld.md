## This is a markdown file

- Markdown was invented by John Gruber who publishes the popular Apple-related blog DaringFireball and is part of Q Branch which created the iOS note-taking application Vesper
- Vesper doesn't support WYSIWYG Markdown support like many other GUI text editors
- That is all :)
